Here I want to show the data:

```{r}
data <- readr::read_csv("data/titanic_clean.csv")
head(data)
```

Here I want to show my eda/plots:

![title](output/titanic1.png){#key}



::: {#fig-titanic1}
![Survival rates by class and gender](output/titanic1.png)
:::


As seen in Figure @fig-titanic1, survival rates varied significantly by class and gender.

we can also reference the image @key like that.



# What about referencing R scripts?

We COULD run the scripts from the actual document, 
although the professor does not like that
```{r}
# source("scripts/analysis.R")
# source("02-eda.R")

```


You can display code from an R script like the following:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#readLines("scripts/analysis.R")

# readLines("02-eda.R")
```

You can also run an Rscript and display its output like this:

```{r}
library(knitr)
#knitr::knit_child("scripts/analysis.R")
# knitr::knit_child("02-eda.R")
```

if you want to include the script as an external code block without running it:

r, code=readLines("scripts/analysis.R")

`{r, code=readLines("02-eda.R")}`


If your R script contains Quarto-friendly code chunks ({r}) and you want to include it as a child document, use:

`{{< include 02-eda.R >}}`

`{{< include scripts/analysis.R >}}`
